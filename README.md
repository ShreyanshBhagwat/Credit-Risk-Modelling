Project Description
This project focuses on building a credit risk prediction model to assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.
The objective is to help financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions by evaluating borrower risk using historical credit data.
The project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling imbalanced data, model training, and performance evaluation.

Business Objective
•	Predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan
•	Identify key factors influencing credit risk
•	Reduce financial losses by improving loan approval decisions
•	Support risk management and underwriting strategies

Dataset
•	Dataset: Credit Risk Modelling Data
•	Contains customer-level financial and demographic information such as:
o	Income and employment details
o	Credit history
o	Loan amount and repayment behavior
o	Target variable: Loan Default (Yes / No)

Methodology & Analysis
•	Data cleaning and preprocessing
•	Handling missing and inconsistent values
•	Encoding categorical variables
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand default patterns
•	Feature selection and scaling
•	Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
•	Train-test split for model validation
•	Built and evaluated classification models:
o	Logistic Regression / Decision Tree (as applicable)
•	Model evaluation using accuracy and cross-validation

Key Insights
•	Borrowers with weaker credit history show higher default probability
•	Certain income and loan characteristics strongly influence risk
•	Handling class imbalance significantly improves model performance
•	Predictive modeling can support more objective credit decisions

Tools & Technologies Used
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Scikit-learn
•	Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
•	Jupyter Notebook

Skills Demonstrated
•	Credit Risk Analysis
•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
